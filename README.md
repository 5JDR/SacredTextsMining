# Text Mining on Sacred Texts
This repository contains the final project for the Foundations of Data Science course, BSc in Internet of Things, Big Data & Web, University of Udine.

The project consists in an analysis through text mining of the 6 sacred texts belonging to the religions with the biggest number of followers:
- Christianity
- Islam
- Judaism
- Hinduism
- Buddhism
- Sikhism

The results are reported in Italian, follows a brief recap of the most interesting results from the analysis:

## Sentiment Analysis
- The texts of the monotheist religions show a slightly negative sentiment on average
- Texts of Buddhism and Hinduism are more balanced
- Rig Veda (Hinduism) is the most positive sacred text
- Christianity and Judaism are prevalent in the richest countries, even though the Old and the New Testament have the most negative sentiment

## Term Frequency Analysis
- In the Old Testament, the names of Jewish historical figures appear very frequently, this shows tightness between the religion and the Jewish people. For the other sacred texts, the references are more generic, making these religions more suitable to different 
ethnicities
- The sacred texts for the 3 Abrahamic religions show similar term frequency distributions

## Topic Modeling
- The most common topics in the sacred texts are God for the monotheist religions, multiple gods and nature for the politheist religions
- The new testament is the sacred text that shows more similarities with all the other religions, this raises a couple of questions:
  - Has christianity spread worldwide thanks to some kind of "adaptability"?
  - Has the new testament been influenced over the centuries in order to "adapt" to new parts of the world where Christianity was spreading?
