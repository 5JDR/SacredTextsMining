"52","FOREWORD"
"53","The Dhammapada, of which a metrical translation by Mr. Woodward is here"
"54","presented, is a precious Buddhist Scripture which deserves to be widely"
"55","known. The Theosophical Society is to be congratulated on securing so"
"56","competent and sympathetic a translator and on publishing it in a popular"
"57","form."
"58","The _Dhammapada_ is a part of the _Khuddaka NikƒÅya_ of the Buddhistic"
"59","Canon and consists of about 420 stanzas in the _sloka_ metre. Every"
"60","fully ordained _bhikkhu_[1] is expected to know the book by heart, and"
"61","its verses are often on the lips of pious laymen. The beginner of"
"62","Buddhist studies can have no better introduction to Buddhism and must go"
"63","back to it again and again to enter into the spirit of Buddha and his"
"64","apostles."
"65","The Scriptures of the Buddhist Canon are known collectively as the"
"66","_Ti-pi·π≠aka_ (Sansk. _Tri-pi·π≠aka_), the Three Baskets or
Treasuries. These divisions correspond to the two Testaments of the"
"67","Christian Bible and contain (excluding repetitions) more than twice as"
"68","much matter. They are known separately as the _Vinaya pi·π≠aka_, _Sutta"
"69","pi·π≠aka_ and _Abhidhamma pi·π≠aka_, the Basket of Discipline, the"
"70","Basket of Discourses and the Basket of Metaphysics. These scriptures are"
"71","regarded with the utmost veneration by Buddhists as containing the word"
"72","of Buddha (_Buddha-vacanam_), and are reputed to have been recited at"
"73","the first Council held, according to tradition, at RƒÅjagaha immediately"
"74","after Buddha's death _circa_ 540 B.C."
"75","It seems more probable that they grew up gradually and did not receive"
"76","their final shape till about three centuries later, at the Council held"
"77","under the auspices of the Emperor Asoka at PƒÅ·π≠aliputra _circa_ 247"
"78","B.C. The account given of the First Council in the closing chapter of"
"79","the _Culla vagga_ seems to indicate that the Basket of Metaphysics was"
"80","then unknown or unrecognised, and that the scriptures were then a"
"81","_Dvi-pi·π≠aka_ (Two Baskets) rather than a _Ti-pi·π≠aka_ (Three"
"82","Baskets)."
"83","If the _Culla vagga_ account is accepted, it would appear that at this"
"84","Council, expressly held by the Emperor for the consecrative settlement"
"85","of the holy texts, the five NikƒÅyas or divisions which constitute the"
"86","second Basket formed the subject of discussion between the President"
"87","Kassappa and Buddha's favourite pupil ƒÄnanda. The _Dhammapada_ is a book"
"88","of the fifth NikƒÅya. The _MahƒÅvansa_ (Ch. v, 68) carries it back a few"
"89","years earlier than the Council, to the time of the Emperor's conversion"
"90","to the Buddhist faith, for on that occasion his teacher, Nigrodha, is"
"91","said to have explained to him the _AppamƒÅda-vagga_, which is the second"
"92","chapter of the work. It was therefore known in the middle or early part"
"93","of the third century B.C."
"94","It seems to be an Anthology, prepared for the use of the faithful, of"
"95","verses believed to be the real words of Buddha, short improvisations in"
"96","which he expressed striking thoughts and embellished his preaching."
"97","They were current among the early Buddhists, and have been culled from"
"98","the other scriptures as of high ethical and spiritual value. The"
"99","importance of the _Dhammapada_ for a critical study of Buddhism is thus"
"100","considerable."
"101","For a thorough understanding of the work and of the orthodox Buddhist"
"102","view of it, it should be studied with the valuable commentary of"
"103","Buddhaghosa. Buddhism owes a profound debt to this great man, and has"
"104","recognised it in the name by which he is known in the Buddhist world."
"105","Says the _MahƒÅvansa_ (Ch. xxxvii, 174): Because he was as profound in
his eloquence (_ghosa_) as Buddha himself, they conferred on him the
appellation of _Buddha-ghosa_ (the Voice of Buddha), and throughout the
world he became as renowned as Buddha. He was an Indian Brahmana and a"
"106","great Vedic scholar and apostle. On his conversion to Buddhism he became"
"107","a not less ardent champion of the new Faith. He came to Ceylon from the"
"108","cradle of Buddhism, the terrace of the great Bo-tree in Buddha GƒÅya,"
"109","in the beginning of the fifth century, _i.e._, nearly a thousand years"
"110","after Buddha's death. He came in search of the old commentaries on the"
"111","Tripi·π≠akas. The commentaries had been brought to Ceylon by the"
"112","Emperor Asoka's son, the apostle Mahinda, and by him translated into"
"113","Sinhalese. They continued to be orally transmitted until reduced to"
"114","writing, in the reign of the Ceylon king, Va·π≠·π≠ƒÅgamini (88-76"
"115","B.C.), at a convocation of learned _bhikkhus_ at the cave-temple of Alu"
"116","VihƒÅre in the Matale district."
"117","The original Pali version having perished in India, Buddhaghosa, during"
"118","his residence in the MahƒÅ-vihƒÅre at Anuradhapura, re-translated it from"
"119","Sinhalese to Pali. His version supplanted the Sinhalese (since lost) and"
"120","is now the only record remaining of the ancient tradition. He also wrote"
"121","elaborate commentaries (_A·π≠·π≠ha kathƒÅ_)[2] on almost every part of"
"122","the Tri-pi·π≠aka and composed the _Visuddhi magga_, an extensive and"
"123","systematic treatise on Buddhist doctrine, a veritable cyclop√¶dia of"
"124","Buddhist theology. His writings are regarded as absolute authorities in"
"125","the interpretation of the Buddhist scriptures, and he is regarded as the"
"126","second founder of Buddhism in Ceylon. He is held in high reverence also"
"127","in Burma as the founder of Buddhism in that country (450 of the"
"128","Christian era), having taken the Buddhist scriptures there from Ceylon."
"129","Buddhaghosa's commentary on the _Dhammapada_ mentions the occasions on"
"130","which, and the audiences to whom, most of the verses were addressed by"
"131","Buddha when, as an itinerant preacher, he went with his followers"
"132","through the land--mid-Ganges valley and sub-Himalayan tract in the"
"133","modern provinces of Agra, Oude and Behar; his watchwords--not wealth,"
"134","fame or dominion, but peace, happiness, deliverance from the burden of"
"135","sorrow and death, and his message: Open ye your ears, the deliverance
from death is found.[3]"
"136","When he first attained enlightenment under the Bodhi-tree (at Buddha"
"137","GƒÅya), a descendant of which still flourishes in Anuradhapura, the"
"138","oldest historical tree in the world, Buddha is said to have broken out"
"139","into a song of triumph which is included in the anthology of the"
"140","_Dhammapada_ (153-4) and has been spiritedly rendered by Mr. Woodward:"
"141","     Through many a round of birth and death I ran,"
"142","     Nor found the builder that I sought. Life's stream"
"143","     Is birth and death and birth with sorrow filled."
"144","     Now house-holder, thou'rt seen! no more shalt build!"
"145","     Broken are all thy rafters, split thy beam!"
"146","     All that made up this mortal self is gone;"
"147","     Mind hath slain craving. I have crossed the stream!"
"148","The way that he claimed to have discovered is known as the Middle Way"
"149","(_MajjhimƒÅ Pa·π≠ipadƒÅ_), equally removed from an ignoble life of"
"150","pleasure and a gloomy life of mortification, and consists in a"
"151","realisation of the Four Great Truths (_cattƒÅri ariya saccƒÅni_) of"
"152","suffering, its origin, its end and the path thereto. All existence, he"
"153","declares, is suffering, its origin is desire, its end is the extinction"
"154","of desire, to be attained by the Eightfold Path (_a·π≠·π≠hangiko"
"155","maggo_) of right belief, right resolve, right speech, right act, right"
"156","occupation, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration and"
"157","tranquillity.[4] The exposition and illustration of the Truths and the"
"158","Way fill numerous tomes of the Buddhist scriptures."
"159","It is these ideals of self-control, self-culture and heroic endeavour,"
"160","the graces of wisdom, purity and love, the eternal law of _Karma_, or"
"161","causality and moral retribution--under which every deed, good or bad,"
"162","comes back most to the doer and yields fruit, helping or marring his"
"163","progress--that are enshrined in the _Dhammapada_ in luminous, pithy"
"164","verse which lingers in the memory as a fountain of noble inspiration."
"165","They are almost too ethereal for human nature's daily food, and it is"
"166","granted to few to realise in actual life these counsels of perfection"
"167","unaided."
"168","Buddha failed to make allowance for the weakness of humanity. His stoic"
"169","agnosticism and self-reliant courage ignored God, denied the soul,"
"170","repudiated worship and prayer and made man the master of his fate. This"
"171","line of thought was not new to India, however stamped with his own"
"172","personality. But human needs and aspirations have asserted themselves,"
"173","and Buddhism has been compelled to absorb elements of doctrine and"
"174","practice which he condemned. This has happened, especially, in the"
"175","countries where the doctrine of the MahƒÅyƒÅna (the Great Vehicle)"
"176","prevails."
"177","In China, AmitƒÅbha (Boundless Light), of whom Gautama Buddha is held to"
"178","be an incarnation, and Kwanyin the Goddess of mercy, have laid great"
"179","hold on the affections of the Buddhist population. Kwanyin (Sansk."
"180","_KanyƒÅ_, the Virgin) is the gracious _Sakti_ (Cosmic Power) of the"
"181","Hindus,"
"182","     Mother of millions of world-clusters,"
"183","     Yet Virgin by the Vedas called."
"184","In Japan, AmitƒÅbha is the Eternal one who is the Light, the Way, and the"
"185","Life, and took human form to open the door of salvation to all. Kwanyin"
"186","shares with him the sovereignty of Heaven. In Tibet are worshipped these"
"187","and other emanations of heavenly beings--Manju Sri, the personification"
"188","of wisdom, Avalokitesvara, the Lord who looketh down on the world"
"189","with mercy to help and protect, VajrapƒÅna, and others, with a host of"
"190","minor deities."
"191","In Ceylon, which claims to belong to the purer faith, Buddhism is"
"192","interwoven with the worship of, the popular gods of the Hindus and with"
"193","animism and demonology. Under MahƒÅyƒÅnist influence Buddha has become a"
"194","God, greater than others, but worshipped less fervently, for (as Robert"
"195","Knox[5] found during his twenty years' residence in the island in the"
"196","seventeenth century) the popular mind looks to Buddha for the soul, to"
"197","the gods for the things of this world. His own doctrine remains a dream"
"198","of philosophers."
"199","Fifty years ago Buddhism was at one of the lowest ebbs in its history in"
"200","the Island. The arrival of Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott, the"
"201","founders of the Theosophical Society, and their zealous propaganda,"
"202","materially helped the efforts of the saintly Sri Sumangala to stem the"
"203","tide, and there arose a renaissance which has had far-reaching effects."
"204","Colonel Olcott by his speech and writings did much to remove the"
"205","prevailing ignorance and indifference, and recalled Buddhists to a sense"
"206","of the value of their Faith.[6] He laid the foundation of that"
"207","educational activity which has filled many parts of the Island with"
"208","Buddhist schools and colleges."
"209","Mr. Woodward is one of the noble band of Theosophists who have carried"
"210","on Colonel Olcott's mission in Ceylon, and is perhaps the greatest of"
"211","them all. Not being a Theosophist or Buddhist, I can speak of him more"
"212","freely. Self-sacrificing zeal and devotion are commonplace words to use"
"213","of him. They are often said of men, good and zealous in their way, who"
"214","have had the compensations of good incomes and creature comforts,"
"215","congenial friends and efficient fellow-workers. Mr. Woodward (or, to"
"216","call him by his Sanskrit name, _VanapƒÅla_) was little favoured in these"
"217","respects. His was a life of ascetic simplicity and self-denial and"
"218","strenuous well-doing. An English gentleman of the best type, he combined"
"219","in a rare degree the culture of the West and Bast, combined also the"
"220","active spirit of the West with the mysticism of the East. He belongs to"
"221","the roll of the great apostles of MahayƒÅnist Buddhism who carried its"
"222","message and its culture over the mountains and deserts of Asia to the"
"223","Pacific Ocean. The Mahinda College, Galle, of which he was the mainstay"
"224","for nearly twenty years, is a shining memorial of him. But who can"
"225","estimate the gracious influence of his personality? The memory of it"
"226","will be a cherished possession to his friends, young and old, and an"
"227","inspiration to them all, and their gratitude and good wishes follow him"
"228","unstintingly to his Tasmanian home."

"232","[1] Usually but erroneously translated priest, ignoring a fundamental"
"233","difference between Buddhism and other religions. Buddhism recognises no"
"234","priesthood. By priest one understands a mediator between God and man,"
"235","a vehicle of divine grace, a person with delegated authority from God to"
"236","administer the sacraments of religion, to admit into the faith or eject"
"237","from it, to absolve from sin, etc. Such an institution can have no place"
"238","in Buddhism. _Bhikkhu_, (literally, a beggar and etymologically the"
"239","same word) is one of a brotherhood of men trying to live as Buddha"
"240","lived, to purify and discipline themselves, earnest pilgrims on the road"
"241","reaching unto deliverance (_NirvƒÅna_). The layman demands from the"
"242","_bhikkhu_ no assistance in heavenly, no interference in worldly,"
"243","affairs, but only that he should live as becomes a follower of the great"
"244","Teacher. The nearest English equivalent of _bhikkhu is_ mendicant
friar."
"245","[2] Sansk. _Artha KathƒÅ_."
"246","[3] _MahƒÅ-vagga_, i, 6-10 _seq._ The message continues: I teach you, I
preach the Norm. If ye walk according to my teaching, ye shall be
partakers, in a short time, of that for which noble youths leave their
homes and go into homelessness, the highest end of religious effort: ye
shall even in the present life apprehend the Truth itself and see it
face to face."

"250","[5] Shipwrecked off Trincomalee in 1660, he remained an unwilling but"
"251","favoured guest of King Raja Sinha II for twenty years. Escaping to"
"252","Europe, he wrote his excellent _Historical Relation of the Island of"
"253","Ceylon_, published 1681."
"254","[6] It was uphill work for Colonel Olcott, but his magnificent courage"
"255","and enthusiasm prevailed over every obstacle. I was then a Magistrate in"
"256","the Kalutara district of the Western Province, and remember that"
"257","well-known Buddhists, appearing as witnesses, would not acknowledge"
"258","their Faith and swore on the Bible rather than affirm. The Portuguese"
"259","and Dutch Governments had persecuted them, and the English Government,"
"260","though it did not persecute, continued for years many disabilities."
"261","TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE"
"262","I made this translation of the _Dhammapada_, intending it to be a simple"
"263","memorial text-book for my pupils, at intervals some seven or eight years"
"264","ago, when reading the PƒÅli as a lesson in religion with my senior class"
"265","in Ceylon. Its publication has been held up for several years owing to"
"266","various causes, and, having left Ceylon in 1919, I was unable owing to"
"267","distance to correct the proofs. My thanks are due to Mr. Fritz Kunz,"
"268","B.A., of Adyar, Madras, for seeing the book through the press. The"
"269","rather long list of alterations[1] is due to the fact that I saw no"
"270","proofs till the whole was printed off, and had meanwhile desired to"
"271","recast certain verses. The use of metre of course often prohibits the"
"272","exact translation of certain philosophical and technical terms, but I"
"273","have kept as close to the original as was possible. I have followed the"
"274","PƒÅli text of Fausb√∂ll (1900), and have been much helped by Dr. Dines"
"275","Andersen's _Glossary of the Words of the Dhammapada_. The PƒÅli Text"
"276","Society's edition of the text (by S≈´riyogo·∏ça Suma·πÖgala Thero)"
"277","appeared just after I had finished, and I have made several alterations"
"278","in accordance with the readings of that edition."

"572","FOOLS."
"573","  60."
"574","  Long is the night to him that is waking,"
"575","  Long is a league to the traveller worn,"
"576","  Long is the coil of births"
"577","  For fools that know not the truth of the Norm."
"578","  61."
"579","  If one find not a comrade to join him in travel."
"580","  Either like unto self or better than self,"
"581","  It is safer to push on alone;"
"582","  What fellowship can there be with a fool?"
"583","  62."
"584","  I am father of sons! I am owner of wealth!"
"585","  Thinks the fool in his folly and thereat is troubled."
"586","  He himself is not owner of self;"
"587","  Much less is he owner of sons and of wealth."
"588","  63."
"589","  Wise indeed is he that knoweth his folly;"
"590","  Fool indeed is the fool that thinks himself wise."
"591","  64."
"592","  Tho' a fool in his folly sit all his life long"
"593","  By the side of a wise man, he never gets wiser,"
"594","  For he knows not the Norm and its worth,"
"595","  As the spoon never knoweth the taste of the broth."
"596","  65."
"597","  But a wise man that sits by the wise but a minute,"
"598","  Quickly learns of the Norm and its worth,"
"599","  As the tongue quickly savours the taste of the broth."
"600","  66."
"601","  Fools fare up and down with themselves for their foe,"
"602","  And work evil deeds whose fruit will be bitter;"
"603","  67."
"604","  Ill-done is the deed that brings sorrow in doing,"
"605","  Whose fruit they will meet with tears and annoy;"
"606","  68."

"609","  69."
"610","  O! how sweet! thinks the fool, ere his wicked deed ripens."
"611","  When his wicked deed ripens he knows what is sorrow."

"615","  Not one fourth of a quarter of good doth he gain"

"617","  71."
"618","  Now an ill deed, like milk, doth not change into curds,"
"619","  But it burneth the fool--a live coal 'neath the ashes."
"620","  72."
"621","  Since his knowledge is born to a fool all in vain,"
"622","  His good luck is lost to him wholly;"
"623","  On his own head it falls; he is crushed by his folly."
"624","  73-4."
"625","  If a fool long for credit that is not his due,"

"632","  Success here is one thing, NibbƒÅna another:"
"633","  When a monk, the Buddha's disciple, is sure"
"634","  Of this truth, he delights not in honour, eschews"

"2076","Master's radiance after attaining _NibbƒÅna_, inquired who was His"
"2077","teacher and what was the cause of His joy."
"2078","[10] _Bhoga_, _rƒÅga_, _dosa_, _moha_, _iccha_, riches, lust, hate,"

"2081","THE MENDICANT."
"2082","  360-1"
"2083","  Good is restraint of eye and ear, of nose and tongue,"
"2084","    Of body, speech and mind; restraint is good"
"2085","    In every way; the mendicant restrained"
"2086","      All sorrow casts away."
"2087","  362."
"2088","  In hand and foot and speech whoso is self restrained;"
"2089","    Whoso to ponder inwardly delights,"
"2090","    Who liveth lonely and is well-content,"
"2091","      Him men call mendicant."
"2092","  363."
"2093","  Whoso controls his lips, and words of wisdom speaks,"
"2094","    Is not puffed up, who can elucidate"
"2095","    The meaning and the essence of The Norm--"
"2096","      Pleasant is he to hear."
"2097","  364."
"2098","  Who dwelleth in the Norm and in the Norm delights,"
"2099","    Who searcheth out and well remembers it--"
"2100","    From the True Norm that steadfast mendicant"
"2101","      Will never fall away."
"2102","  365."
"2103","  Let him not think of little worth the alms he gains."
"2104","    Nor jealous be of alms to others given;"
"2105","    For whoso envies other mendicants"
"2106","      Wins not tranquillity."
"2107","  366."
"2108","  Though small the part of charity that falls to him,"
"2109","    Whoso despiseth not the alms he gains,"
"2110","    If he live clean, not given to slothfulness,"
"2111","      E'en by the gods is praised.[1]"
"2112","  367."
"2113","  Whoso hath neither part nor lot in Name and Form[2]"
"2114","    (Who saith not this is I or this is mine)"
"2115","    And grieveth not for what existeth not,"
"2116","      A mendicant is called."
"2117","  368."
"2118","  Whoso in friendly wise with all mankind abides,"
"2119","    Firm in the teaching of the Awakened One;"
"2120","    Reaches the bliss where all conditions cease,"
"2121","      Reaches the State of Peace."
"2122","  369."
"2123","  O mendicants! bail out the water from this boat![3]"
"2124","    Swift will it go when from this burden freed."
"2125","    Of passion and of hatred cut the root;"
"2126","      Then shalt thou reach The Peace."
"2127","  370."
"2128","  Cut off the five; desert the five; the five subdue!"
"2129","    That mendicant, who from the fetters five[4]"
"2130","    Hath freed himself at last, by men is called"
"2131","      A crosser of the Stream."
"2132","  371."
"2133","  O mendicant! be meditative; let not sloth,[5]"
"2134","    Let not thy passions toss thee to and fro;[6]"
"2135","    Lest, swallowing the ball, thou burning cry,"
"2136","      Ah! this is suffering!"
"2137","  372."
"2138","  Who hath no wisdom cannot ecstasy attain;[7]"
"2139","    Who knows not ecstasy, no wisdom gains;"
"2140","    Whoso both ecstasy and wisdom hath,"
"2141","      Unto The Peace is nigh."
"2142","  373."
"2143","  The mendicant, whose mind hath gained tranquillity,"
"2144","    When he hath entered on his empty cell,[8]"
"2145","    Hath joy beyond man's power to tell, for he"
"2146","      The Truth discerneth well."
"2147","  374."
"2148","  Soon as he grasps the rise and fall of elements,[9]"
"2149","    Such pleasure and delight thereby he wins"
"2150","    As falls to them that rightly know the state"
"2151","      Of immortality.[10]"
"2152","  375."
"2153","  Let the wise mendicant in this world thus begin;"
"2154","    Guard thou thy senses; next, with mind content,"
"2155","    By discipline restrained, seek noble friends"
"2156","      Who zealous live and pure;"
"2157","  376."
"2158","  And by the laws of friendship act, live perfectly,"
"2159","    And upright walk according to the Norm;"
"2160","    Then in the fullness of thy joy thou shalt"
"2161","      An end of suffering make."
"2162","  377."
"2163","  O mendicants! just as the snow-white _vassik√¢_,"
"2164","    The jasmine, putting forth fresh blooms to-day,"
"2165","    Sheds down the withered blooms of yesterday,"
"2166","      So shed ye lust and hate."
"2167","  378."
"2168","  Tranquil in body, speech and mind, O mendicants,"
"2169","    Whoso in every way is well-restrained,"
"2170","    Who all this world's desires hath thrown aside"
"2171","      He is the tranquil called."
"2172","  379."
"2173","  Rouse thou the self by self, by self examine self;"
"2174","    Thus guarded by the self, and with thy mind"
"2175","    Intent and watchful, thus, O mendicant,"
"2176","      Thou shall live happily."
"2177","  380."
"2178","  Yea! Self is guard of self and refuge takes in self;"
"2179","    Just as a dealer trains a thoroughbred,"
"2180","    A noble steed, and breaks him to the rein,"
"2181","      So do thou self restrain."
"2182","  381."
"2183","  That mendicant, with utter joy and gladness filled,"
"2184","    Firm in the teaching of the Awakened One,"
"2185","    Reaches the bliss where all conditions cease,"
"2186","      Reaches the State of Peace."
"2187","  382."
"2188","  Lo ye! a mendicant, though young he be, that strives"
"2189","    To grasp the teaching of the Awakened One,"
"2190","    Lights up the world, as from a cloud released"
"2191","      The moon lights up the night."
"2192","[1] Cf. vv. 229-30."
"2193","[2] _NƒÅma r≈´pa_, a traditional Vedic term for mind and Matter, the"

"2195","mental and bodily compound in the individual, cf. _Buddhist Psychology_,"
"2196","Mrs. C.A. Rhys-Davids, pp. 23-5."
"2197","[3] The body with its needs and passions (water in the boat) hampers the"

"2204","III. If the verb of the third clause, _vuttaribhƒÅvaye_, be translated"

five good qualities of _faith_, _zeal_, _concentration_, _meditation_,
_wisdom_."
"2206","IV. This may refer to the second five fetters, by throwing off which one"
"2207","becomes an Arahat."

"2218","THE BRAHMANA."
"2219","  383."
"2220","  Cut off the stream,[1] O BrƒÅhmana, right manfully;"
"2221","    Repel desires; when thou hast known the end"
"2222","      Of things conditioned, thou shalt be"
"2223","        A knower of the Uncreate.[2]"
"2224","  384."
"2225","  When by the twofold law (restraint and ecstasy),"
"2226","    By virtue of the knowledge he hath gained,"
"2227","      The BrƒÅhmana hath crossed the stream;"

"2229","  385."
"2230","  Whoso the stream hath crossed and from this shore hath passed,[3]"

"2233","        Him I deem a BrƒÅhma·πáa."
"2234","  386."
"2235","  Whoso dwells meditiative, passionless,"

"2237","      Whoso hath won the highest Goal--"

"2239","  387."
"2240","  One who is rid of evil is a BrƒÅma·πáa;"

"2242","      Gone forth from all impurity;"
"2243","         The hermit is _pabbajjƒÅ_ called.[4]"
"2244","  388."
"2245","  Let not a BrƒÅhma·πáa assail a BrƒÅhma·πáa;"

"2249","  390."
"2250","  No little profit cometh to the BrƒÅhma·πáa"
