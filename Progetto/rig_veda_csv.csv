"33","PREFACE."
"34","In accordance with the general object of this series of volumes--which"
"35","is to furnish materials for study rather than to offer completed"
"36","studies--I have prepared for this number the text of the most ancient"
"37","authentic record of American religious lore. From its antiquity and"
"38","character, I have ventured to call this little collection the RIG VEDA"
"39","AMERICANUS, after the similar cyclus of sacred hymns, which are the most"
"40","venerable product of the Aryan mind."
"41","As for my attempted translation of these mystic chants I offer it with"
"42","the utmost reserve. It would be the height of temerity in me to pretend"
"43","to have overcome difficulties which one so familiar with the ancient"
"44","Nahuatl as Father Sahagun intimated were beyond his powers. All that I"
"45","hope to have achieved is, by the aid of the Gloss--and not always in"
"46","conformity to its suggestions--to give a general idea of the sense and"
"47","purport of the originals."
"48","The desirability of preserving and publishing these texts seems to me to"
"49","be manifest. They reveal to us the undoubtedly authentic spirit of the"
"50","ancient religion; they show us the language in its most archaic form;"
"51","they preserve references to various mythical cycli of importance to the"
"52","historian; and they illustrate the alterations in the spoken tongue"
"53","adopted in the esoteric dialect of the priesthood. Such considerations"
"54","will, I trust, attract the attention of scholars to these fragments of a"
"55","lost literature."
"56","In the appended Vocabulary I have inserted only those words and"
"57","expressions for which I can suggest correct--or, at least,"
"58","probable--renderings. Others will have to be left to future"
"59","investigators."

"91","INTRODUCTION."
"92","As in a previous number of the Library of Aboriginal American Literature"
"93","I have discussed in detail the character of the ancient Mexican poetry,"
"94","I shall confine myself at present to the history of the present"
"95","collection. We owe its preservation to the untiring industry of Father"
"96","Bernardino de Sahagun, one of the earliest missionaries to Mexico, and"
"97","the author of by far the most important work on the religion, manners"
"98","and customs of the ancient Mexicans."
"99","By long residence and close application Sahagun acquired a complete"
"100","mastery of the Nahuatl tongue. He composed his celebrated _Historia de"
"101","las Cosas de la Nueva Espa√±a_ primarily in the native language, and from"
"102","this original wrote out a Spanish translation, in some parts"
"103","considerably abbreviated. This incomplete reproduction is that which was"
"104","published in Spanish by Lord Kingsborough and Bustamente, and in a"
"105","French rendering with useful notes by Dr. Jourdanet and M. R√©mi Simeon."
"106","So far as I know, the only complete copy of the Nahuatl original now in"
"107","existence is that preserved in the Bibliotheca Laurentio-Mediceana in"
"108","Florence, where I examined it in April, 1889. It is a most elaborate and"
"109","beautiful MS., in three large volumes, containing thirteen hundred and"
"110","seventy-eight illustrations, carefully drawn by hand, mostly colored,"
"111","illustrative of the native mythology, history, arts and usages, besides"
"112","many elaborate head and tail pieces to the chapters."
"113","There is another Nahuatl MS. of Sahagun's history in the private"
"114","library of the King of Spain at Madrid, which I examined in May, 1888,"
"115","and of which I published a collation in the _M√©moires de la Soci√©t√®"
"116","Internationale des Am√©ricanistes_, for that year. It is incomplete,"
"117","embracing only the first six books of the _Historia_, and should be"
"118","considered merely as a _borrador_ or preliminary sketch for the"
"119","Florentine copy. It contains, however, a certain amount of material not"
"120","included in the latter, and has been peculiarly useful to me in the"
"121","preparation of the present volume, as not only affording another reading"
"122","of the text, valuable for comparison, but as furnishing a gloss or"
"123","Nahuatl paraphrase of most of the hymns, which does not appear in the"
"124","Florentine MS. As evidently the older of the two, I have adopted the"
"125","readings of the Madrid MS. as my text, and given the variants of the"
"126","Florentine MS. at the end of each hymn."
"127","Neither MS. attempts any translation of the hymns. That at Madrid has no"
"128","Spanish comment whatever, while that at Florence places opposite the"
"129","hymns the following remarks, which are also found in the printed copies,"
"130","near the close of the Appendix of the Second Book of the _Historia_:--"
"131","It is an old trick of our enemy the Devil to try to conceal himself in
order the better to compass his ends, in accordance with the words of
the Gospel, 'He whose deeds are evil, shuns the light.' Also on earth
this enemy of ours has provided himself with a dense wood and a ground,
rough and filled with abysses, there to prepare his wiles and to escape
pursuit, as do wild beasts and venomous serpents. This wood and these
abysses are the songs which he has inspired for his service to be sung
in his honor within the temples and outside of them; for they are so
artfully composed that they say what they will, but disclose only what
the Devil commands, not being rightly understood except by those to whom
they are addressed. It is, in fact, well recognized that the cave, wood
or abysses in which this cursed enemy hides himself, are these songs or
chants which he himself composed, and which are sung to him without
being understood except by those who are acquainted with this sort of
language. The consequence is that they sing what they please, war or
peace, praise to the Devil or contempt for Christ, and they cannot in
the least be understood by other men."
"132","Lord Kingsborough says in a note in his voluminous work on the"
"133","_Antiquities of Mexico_ that this portion of Sahagun's text was"
"134","destroyed by order of the Inquisition, and that there was a memorandum"
"135","to that effect in the Spanish original in the noble writer's possession."
"136","This could scarcely have referred to a translation of the hymns, for"
"137","none such exists in any MS. I have consulted, or heard of; and Sahagun"
"138","intimates in the passage quoted above that he had made none, on account"
"139","of the obscurity of the diction. Neither does any appear in the"
"140","Florentine MS., where the text of the hymns is given in full, although"
"141","the explanatory Gloss is omitted. This last-mentioned fact has prevented"
"142","me from correcting the text of the Gloss, which in some passages is"
"143","manifestly erroneous; but I have confined myself to reproducing it"
"144","strictly according to the original MS., leaving its correction to those"
"145","who will make use of it."
"146","The Florentine MS. has five colored illustrations of the divinities, or"
"147","their symbols, which are spoken of in the chants. These are probably"
"148","copied from the native hieroglyphic books in which, as we learn from"
"149","Sahagun, such ancient songs were preserved and transmitted. These"
"150","illustrations I had copied with scrupulous fidelity and reproduced by"
"151","one of the photographic processes, for the present work."
"152","Such is the history of this curious document, and with this brief"
"153","introduction I submit it to those who will have the patience and skill"
"154","to unravel its manifold difficulties."

"193","_The Hymn of Huitzilopochtli._"
"194","  1. Huitzilopochtli is first in rank, no one, no one is like unto him:"
"195","not vainly do I sing (his praises) coming forth in the garb of our"
"196","ancestors; I shine; I glitter."
"197","  2. He is a terror to the Mixteca; he alone destroyed the"
"198","Picha-Huasteca, he conquered them."
"199","  3. The Dart-Hurler is an example to the city, as he sets to work. He"
"200","who commands in battle is called the representative of my God."
"201","  4. When he shouts aloud he inspires great terror, the divine hurler,"
"202","the god turning himself in the combat, the divine hurler, the god"
"203","turning himself in the combat."
"204","  5. Amanteca, gather yourselves together with me in the house of war"
"205","against your enemies, gather yourselves together with me."
"206","  6. Pipiteca, gather yourselves together with me in the house of war"
"207","against your enemies, gather yourselves together with me."
"208","_Notes._"
"209","Huitzilopochtli was the well-known war-god of the Azteca, whose"
"210","functions are described by Sahagun (_Historia_, Lib. I., cap. 1) and"
"211","many other writers. The hymn here given is probably the _tlaxotecuyotl_,"
"212","which was chanted at the celebration of his feast in the fifteenth month"
"213","of the Mexican calendar (see Sahagun, _Historia_, Lib. II., cap. 34)."
"214","The word means his glory be established. It was commenced at sunset"
"215","and repeated till sunrise."
"216","  1. In the garb of our ancestors (_to-citli-quemitl_). The high"
"217","priest appeared in the insignia of Quetzalcoatl, which, says Sahagun,"
"218","were very gorgeous. (_Hist._, Lib. II., Appendix.)"
"219","  2. Mixteca, plural of Mixtecatl, an inhabitant of Mixtecapan, near the"
"220","Pacific. The Huasteca, a nation of Maya lineage, lived on the Gulf"
"221","coast."
"222","  3. The god was called the Hurler, as he was believed to hurl the"
"223","lightning serpent (the _xiuhcoatl_)."
"224","  5. Sahagun recites the legends about the Amanteca (_Historia_, Lib."
"225","IX., cap. 18). Here the name refers to the inhabitants of the quarter"
"226","called Amantlan."
"227","  6. _Pipiteca_, a _nomen gentile_, referring doubtless to a certain"
"228","class of the hearers."
"229","This hymn may be compared to another, descriptive of the same divinity,"
"230","preserved in Sahagun's MS. in Madrid. It is as follows, with my"
"231","translation by its side."
"232","Vitzilopuchtli                     Huitzilopochtli,"
"233","Can maceualli                      Only a subject,"
"234","Can tlacatl catca.                 Only a mortal was."
"235","Naualli                            A magician,"
"236","Tetzauitl                          A terror,"
"237","Atlacacemelle                      A stirrer of strife,"
"238","Teixcuepani                        A deceiver,"
"239","Quiyocoyani in yaoyotl             A maker of war,"
"240","Yautecani                          An arranger of battles,"
"241","Yautlatoani;                       A lord of battles;"
"242","Ca itechpa mitoaya                 And of him it was said"
"243","Tepan quitlaza                     That he hurled"
"244","In xiuhcoatl                       His flaming serpent,"
"245","Immamalhuaztli                     His fire stick;"
"246","Quitoznequi yaoyotl                Which means war,"
"247","Teoatl tlachinolli.                Blood and burning;"
"248","Auh iniquac ilhuiq'xtililoya       And when his festival was celebrated,"
"249","Malmicouaya                        Captives were slain,"
"250","Tlaaltilmicoaya                    Washed slaves were slain,"
"251","Tealtilaya impochteca.             The merchants washed them."
"252","Auh inic mochichiuaya:             And thus he was arrayed:"
"253","Xiuhtotonacoche catca              With head-dress of green feathers,"
"254","Xiuhcoanauale                      Holding his serpent torch,"
"255","Xiuhtlalpile                       Girded with a belt,"
"256","Matacaxe                           Bracelets upon his arms,"
"257","Tzitzile                           Wearing turquoises,"
"258","Oyuvale.                           As a master of messengers."
"259","When in Florence, in 1889, I had an accurate copy made of the Nahuatl"
"260","text and all the figures of the first book of Sahagun's History. The"

"283","no one curse my children."
"284","  2. Our adornment comes from out the south, it is varied in color as"

"297","shines forth, he shines forth, descending as an example."
"298","_Notes._"
"299","There is no Gloss to this hymn, but its signification seems clear."
"300","_Huitznahuac_ was a name applied to several edifices in the great temple"
"301","at Tenochtitlan, as we are informed at length by Sahagun. The word is a"
"302","locative from _huitznahua_. This term means magicians from the south"
"303","or diviners with thorns, and was applied in the Quetzalcoatl mythical"
"304","cyclus to the legendary enemies of Huitzilopochtli, whom he is said to"
"305","have destroyed as soon as he was born. (See my discussion of this myth"
"306","in _Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society_ for 1887.)"
"307","Apparently to perpetuate the memory of this exploit, the custom was, at"
"308","the festival of Huitzilopochtli, for the slaves who were to be"
"309","sacrificed to form two bands, one representing the Huitznahua and the"
"310","other the partisans of the god, and to slaughter each other until the"
"311","arrival of the god Paynal put an end to the combat (Sahagun,"
"312","_Historia_, Lib. II., cap. 34). The song here given belongs to this"
"313","portion of the ancient rite."
"314","  1. The _tlacochcalli_, house of arrows (_tlacochtli_, arrow,"
"315","_calli_, house), was a large hall in the temple of Huitzilopochtli where"
"316","arrows, spears and other arms were kept (Sahagun, Lib. VIII., cap. 32)."
"317","  2. The adornment from the south refers to the meaning of the name"
"318","_Huitznahua_. (See Glossary.)"
"319","  3. Sahagun (_ubi sup._) informs us that the slaves condemned to die"
"320","fought against free warriors, and when any of the latter were captured"
"321","they were promptly put to death by their captors."

"378","directions, and no one weeps."
"379","  2. I, the god, have returned again, I have turned again to the place"
"380","of abundance of blood-sacrifices; there when the day grows old, I am"
"381","beheld as a god."
"382","  3. Thy work is that of a noble magician; truly thou hast made thyself"
"383","to be of our flesh; thou hast made thyself, and who dare affront thee?"
"384","  4. Truly he who affronts me does not find himself well with me; my"
"385","fathers took by the head the tigers and the serpents."
"386","  5. In Tlalocan, in the verdant house, they play at ball, they cast the"
"387","reeds."
"388","  6. Go forth, go forth to where the clouds are spread abundantly, where"
"389","the thick mist makes the cloudy house of Tlaloc."
"390","  7. There with strong voice I rise up and cry aloud."
"391","  8. Go ye forth to seek me, seek for the words which I have said, as I"
"392","rise, a terrible one, and cry aloud."
"393","  9. After four years they shall go forth, not to be known, not to be"
"394","numbered, they shall descend to the beautiful house, to unite together"
"395","and know the doctrine."
"396","  10. Go forth, go forth to where the clouds are spread abundantly,"
"397","where the thick mist makes the cloudy house of Tlaloc."
"398","_Notes._"
"399","The god Tlaloc shared with Huitzilopochtli the highest place in the"
"400","Mexican Pantheon. He was the deity who presided over the waters, the"
"401","rains, the thunder and the lightning. The annual festival in his honor"
"402","took place about the time of corn-planting, and was intended to secure"
"403","his favor for this all-important crop. Its details are described at"
"404","great length by Diego Duran, _Historia de Nueva Espa√±a_, cap. 86, and"
"405","Sahagun, _Historia_, Lib. II., cap. 25, and elsewhere. His name is"
"406","derived from _tlalli_, earth. _Tlalocan_, referred to in v. 5, the
place of Tlaloc, was the name of a mountain east of Tenochtitlan, where"
"407","the festival of the god was celebrated; but it had also a mythical"
"408","meaning, equivalent to the earthly Paradise, the abode of happy souls."
"409","It will be observed that v. 10 is a repetition of v. 6. The word"
"410","_ayauicalo_ refers to the _ayauhcalli_, house of mist, the home of the"
"411","rain god, which Sahagun informs us was represented at the annual"
"412","festival by four small buildings near the water's edge, carefully"
"413","disposed to face the four cardinal points of the compass (Sahagun, _ubi"
"414","supra_)."
"415","In v. 8 the expression _tetzauhpilli_ (_tetzauhqui_, to frighten) may"
"416","be explained by the figure of Tlaloc, whose statue, says Duran, was that"
"417","of _un espantable monstruo, la cara muy fea_ (_ibid._)."
"418","The compound in v. 10, _nauhxiuhtica_, after four years, appears to"
"419","refer to the souls of the departed brave ones, who, according to Aztec"
"420","mythology, passed to the heaven for four years and after that returned"
"421","to the terrestrial Paradise,--the palace of Tlaloc. (See my paper, _The"
"422","Journey of the Soul_, in _Proceedings of the Numismatic and Antiquarian"
"423","Society of Philadelphia, 1883_.)"

"458","  2. Hail to our mother, who poured forth flowers in abundance, who"

"466","  6. Ho! she is our mother, goddess of the earth, she supplies food in"

"468","  7. Thus, thus, you see her to be an ever-fresh model of liberality"
"469","toward all flesh."
"470","  8. And as you see the goddess of the earth do to the wild beasts, so"
"471","also does she toward the green herbs and the fishes."
"472","_Notes._"
"473","The goddess to whom this hymn is devoted was called _Teteoinan_, the"
"474","Mother of the Gods, _To√ßi_, our Mother (maternal ancestor), and also by"
"475","another name which signified the Heart of the Earth, the latter being"
"476","bestowed upon her, says Duran, because she was believed to be the cause"
"477","of earthquakes. Her general functions were those of a genius of"
"478","fertility, extending both to the vegetable and the animal world. Thus,"
"479","she was the patroness of the native midwives and of women in childbirth"
"480","(Sahagun). Her chief temple at Tepeyacac was one of the most renowned in"
"481","ancient Mexico, and it was a felicitous idea of the early missionaries"
"482","to have Our Lady of Guadalupe make her appearance on the immediate"
"483","site of this ancient fane already celebrated as the place of worship of"
"484","the older female deity. The _Codex Ramirez_ makes her a daughter of the"
"485","first King of Culhuacan."
"486","  1. _Tamoanchan._ This word Sahagun translates we seek our homes,"
"487","while the _Codex Telleriano-Remensis_ gives the more intelligible"
"488","rendering there is their home whither they descend, and adds that it"
"489","is synonymous with _Xochitlycacan_, the place where the flowers are
lifted. It was the mystical Paradise of the Aztecs, the Home of the"
"490","Gods, and the happy realm of departed souls. The Codex just quoted adds"
"491","that the gods were born there, which explains the introduction of the"
"492","word into this hymn."

"511","  2. On the Coatepec was her labor; on the mountain he ripened into age;"
"512","as he became a man truly the earth was shaken, even as he became a man."
"513","_Notes._"
"514","The goddess Chimalipan is not mentioned by the authorities at my"
"515","command; but from the tenor of the hymn it is evident that the name is"
"516","a synonym for the virgin mother of Huitzilopochtli, who is distinctly"
"517","referred to by his title _Yautlatoani_ (see _ante_, p. 18). In the myth,"
"518","she dwelt upon the Coatepetl, the Serpent Mountain, on the site of"
"519","Tulan. For a full discussion of this myth I refer to my inquiry, _Were
the Toltecs an Historic Nationality?_ in _Proceedings of the Amer."
"520","Phil. Soc._ for Sept. 1887, and _American Hero-Myths_, chap. 11."
"521","(Phila., 1881)."
"522","The Gloss distinctly states that the mother of Huitzilopochtli is"
"523","referred to in the hymn. We must regard Chimalipan therefore as"
"524","identical with _Chimalman_, who, according to another myth dwelt in Tula"
"525","as a virgin, and was divinely impregnated by the descending spirit of"
"526","the All-father in the shape of a bunch of feathers."
"527","In other myths she is mentioned as also the mother of the Huitznahua,"

"574","Torquemada gives as his synonyms _Xiuhtecutli_, Lord of Fire, and"
"575","_Huehueteotl_, the Ancient God (_Monarquia Indiana_, Lib. VI., cap."
"576","28). Elsewhere he identifies him with the Sun-god (_Ibid._, Lib. XIV.,"
"577","cap. 4). Sahagun describes his annual festival (_Hist._, Lib. II., cap."
"578","38), and gives another of his names, _Cue√ßaltzin_, a reverential form of"
"579","_cuezalotl_, flame (_Hist._, Lib. I., cap. 13)."
"580","The _tzonmolco_ so often referred to in this hymn was the sixty-fourth"
"581","edifice in the great temple of Tenochtitlan, and was devoted to the"
"582","worship of Ixco√ßauhqui (Sahagun). The word literally means the place of
spreading hairs, the rays or ornaments spreading from the head of the"
"583","statue of the god representing flames (Sahagun)."

"622","_Notes._"
"623","The Chichimecs, says Sahagun (_Hist._, Lib. VI., cap. 7), worshipped
only one god, called _Mixcoatl_. The _Anales de Cuauhtitlan_ speaks of"
"624","Mixcoatl as one of the leaders of the ancient Nahuas from their"
"625","primitive home Chicomoztoc, the land of the Seven Caves. This is what is"
"626","referred to in the above hymn. In later times Mixcoatl became god of"
"627","hunting and of the tornado, and his worship extended to the Otomis."
"628","_Tzihuactitlan_, the land of the tzihuac bushes, I have not found"
"629","mentioned by any of the Spanish authorities, but it is named in"
"630","connection with Chicomoztoc in an ancient war-song given in my _Ancient"
"631","Nahuatl Poetry_, pp. 88 and 140."
"632","The hymn appears to be in memory of the leadership of Mixcoatl in"
"633","conducting the ancestors of the Nahua on their long wanderings after"
"634","leaving their pristine seats. It should be read in connection with the"
"635","earlier pages of the _Annals of Cuauhtitlan_."
"636","The reduplicated form of the name, _Mimixcoatl_, is not found elsewhere,"

"671","_Xochipilli_, lord of flowers, otherwise named _Macuilxochitl_, five
flowers (the name of a small odorous plant), was the deity who gave and"

"695","_Xochiquetzal_, plumage of flowers, was the deity of the artists, the"
"696","painters, weavers, engravers on metal, silver and goldsmiths, and of all"
"697","who dealt in fine colors. Her figure was that of a young woman with gay"
"698","garments and jewelry (Duran, _Historia_, cap. 94). In the _Codex"
"699","Telleriano-Remensis_ she is assigned as synonyms _Ichpochtli_, the"
"700","Virgin, and _Itzpapalotl_, literally the obsidian butterfly, but which"
"701","was probably applied to a peculiar ornament of her idol."
"702","On _Tamoanchan_ see notes to Hymn IV."
"703","The term _atlayauican_, which I have translated the dancing place by
the water, appears to refer to the jar dance, _baile de las jicaras_,"

"705","October. Duran informs us this was executed at a spot by the shore of"

"739","_Amimitl_, the water-arrow, or fish-spear, was, according to"

"743","and questionable grounds Clavigero identifies him with Opochtli, the god"

"772","The absence of a Gloss to this hymn adds to the difficulty of a"
"773","translation. _Otontecutli_ was the chief deity of the Otomis, and the"

"775","Azteca. The name is a compound of _otomitl_, an Otomi, and _tecutli_,"

"860","_Notes._"
"861","Cihuacoatl was the mythical mother of the human race. Her name,"
"862","generally translated serpent woman, should be rendered woman of
twins or bearing twins, as the myth related that such was her"
"863","fertility that she always bore two children at one lying-in."
"864","(Torquemada, _Monarquia Indiana_, Lib. VI., cap. 31.) She was also known"
"865","by the title _Tonan_ or _Tonantzin_, our mother, as in v. 5 and 6."
"866","Still another of her appellations was _Quilaztli_, which is given her in"
"867","v. 1. (Comp. Sahagun, _Historia_, Lib. VI., cap. 27.) She was"
"868","essentially a goddess of fertility and reproduction. The name"
"869","_cihuacoatl_ was also applied to one of the higher magistrates and war"
"870","chiefs in the Aztec army (Sahagun). Reference is made to this in v. 6."
"871","As a goddess of venerable antiquity, she is spoken of as coming from"
"872","Colhuacan, the place of the old men, or of the ancestors of the tribe."
"873","This name is derived from _coloa_, to bend down, as an aged person,"
"874","_colli_, an old man. (See my _Ancient Nahuatl Poetry_, pp. 172-3)."

"937","_Notes._"
"938","In default of a Gloss to this hymn, the indispensable Sahagun again"
"939","comes to our aid. He informs us in the Appendix to the second book of"
"940","his _Historia_ that When the Indians celebrated the festival called
_atamalqualiztli_, which took place every eight years, certain natives
called Mazateca swallowed living serpents and frogs, and received
garments as a recompense for their daring. We are not informed as to"
"941","the purpose of the festival, and its name, which signifies eating
bread made with water, is merely that of one of the regular systems of"
"942","fasting in vogue in ancient Mexico. (See Sahagun, Lib. III., cap. 8.)"
"943","The song before us appears to be a recitation calling on a number of the"
"944","Nahua divinities."
"945","  1. The flower in my heart is a metaphorical expression for song."
"946","  2. _Tonan_, Our Mother; _Tlazolteotl_, the goddess of lascivious"
"947","love, _Venus impudica_. The verb _yecoa_ appears to have its early"
"948","signification, expressing carnal connection."
"949","  3. _Centeotl_, god of maize and fertility."
"950","  8. The flowers referred to are the youths and maidens who die young."
"951","  9. The house of the ball player is the tomb."

"1000","There is slight mention of the deity Xipe Totec in the Spanish writers."
"1001","He was the patron divinity of the silversmiths, and his festival,"
"1002","attended with peculiarly bloody rites, was celebrated in the first month"
"1003","of the calendar. (Duran, _Historia_, cap. 87; Sahagun, Lib. I., cap. 18,"
"1004","Lib. II., cap. 21, etc.) Totec is named as one of the companions of"
"1005","Quetzalcoatl, and an ancient divinity whose temple stood on the"
"1006","_Tzatzitepec_ (see the _Codex Vaticanus_; Tab. XII., in Kingsborough's"
"1007","_Mexico_). His high priest was called _Youallauan_, the nocturnal
tippler (_youalli_, night, and _tlauana_, to drink to slight"
"1008","intoxication), and it was his duty to tear out the hearts of the human"
"1009","victims (Sahagun, _u.s._). The epithet _Yoatzin_, noble night-god,"
"1010","bears some relation to the celebration of his rites at night."

"1029","The goddess Chicomecoatl, seven guests, was the deity who presided"
"1030","over food and drink. Hence in the first verse she is referred to as"
"1031","Chicomolotl, seven ears of corn, and is spoken of as a guide to"
"1032","Tlalocan, or the home of abundance."
"1033","Father Duran, who gives a long chapter on this goddess (_Historia_, cap."
"1034","92), translates her name serpent of seven heads, and adds that she was"
"1035","also called _Chalciucihuatl_, Lady of the Emerald, and _Xilonen_,"
"1036","goddess of the tender ears of maize. Every kind of seed and vegetable"
"1037","which served for food was under her guardianship, and hence her festival,"
"1038","held about the middle of September, was particularly solemn. Her statue"
"1039","represented her as a girl of about twelve years old."

"1069","Tezcatzoncatl was one of the chief gods of the native inebriating"

"1071","is seen from his other names, _Tequechmecaniani_, he who hangs people,"
"1072","and _Teatlahuiani_, he who drowns people. Sahagun remarks, They
always regarded the pulque as a bad and dangerous article. The word"
"1073","_Totochtin_, plural of _tochtli_, rabbit, was applied to drunkards, and"
"1074","also to some of the deities of special forms of drunkenness."
"1075","The first verse is merely a series of lamentations. The second speaks of"
"1076","the sad effects of the pulque in ancient times. (On Colhuacan see Notes"
